# Simple IPFS Interface
This is a small proof-of-concept for interfacing with IPFS. It simply pulls up an Infura node and allows you to submit a file to it. Dockerized it so I can use it on multiple machines.

## Setup
1. Setup Docker
2. Run `docker run -p 8080:8080 alex6614/ipfs-interface-docker:ver3`
